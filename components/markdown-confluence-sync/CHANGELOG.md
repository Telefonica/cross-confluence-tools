  GitHub-flavored markdown alerts ([!NOTE], [!TIP], [!IMPORTANT],
  [!WARNING], [!CAUTION]) are now converted to Confluence's native

## [2.1.1] - 2025-07-11

### Fixed

The API was not returning it as a child of the parent page, so the library was trying to create it as a new page instead of updating it. Now, we use another API call to get all children pages.
